# BMI Calculator 🧮

A **Python-based GUI BMI Calculator** developed using **Tkinter** and **Matplotlib** as part of my **Remote Internship Task** in Python Programming.  
This project calculates the **Body Mass Index (BMI)**, classifies the results into categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese), and provides a healthy weight range recommendation.  
It also allows you to **view BMI history** and **visualize trends** in a plotted graph.


## 🚀 Features
- **User-friendly GUI** built with Tkinter.
- Supports **metric (kg, meters)** and **imperial (lbs, feet)** units.
- **Instant BMI calculation** with category classification.
- **Healthy weight range** recommendation based on height.
- **History tracking** of all BMI calculations.
- **Trend visualization** using Matplotlib.

## 📥 Installation & Usage

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bmi-calculator.git
   cd bmi-calculator
   
2. **Install dependencies (if not already installed)**
   pip install matplotlib
   
3. **Run the application**
   python bmi_calculator.py

📊 BMI Categories

| BMI Value   | Category    |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| < 18.5      | Underweight |
| 18.5 – 24.9 | Normal      |
| 25 – 29.9   | Overweight  |
| ≥ 30        | Obese       |

💡 How It Works

Enter weight and height along with their respective units.

Click Calculate BMI to get your BMI value, category, and healthy weight range.

Use Show History to view all previous BMI calculations.

Click Show Trend to visualize your BMI progress.
